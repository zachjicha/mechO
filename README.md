# mechanical Orchestra

One of the successors to Stepper-Music. This version is made in C and is designed to run on Raspberry Pi Zero, but should work on any Pi. The other successor (coming soon) is preferred to this one, but requires arduino. THis works with only pi, but can occasionaly stutter, possibly due to the OS running on the pi.
